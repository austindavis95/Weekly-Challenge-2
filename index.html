              This is Run Buddy, my first coding assignment! Thoughtout my weekly assginments, Ive followed step by step instructions to build this interactive site. Building this site form scratch hes really help me understand the process of web development. The step by step instructions help visulize how HTML and CSS work together to build a page.
